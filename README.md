# Application Overview

## Purpose
The application serves as a flexible, configurable interface to the inotify system. While inotify itself provides the low-level event detection mechanism, the application adds several important layers of functionality.

## Features

### User-friendly Configuration
- Command-line interface to specify directories to watch
- Pattern matching to filter which files to monitor (e.g., only \*.txt files)
- Options to run as a daemon or interactive process

### Event Processing and Filtering
- Interprets the raw inotify events
- Applies pattern filters to focus on relevant files
- Categorizes events into meaningful types (creation, deletion, modification)

### Callback System
- Provides a framework for registering custom actions to specific events
- Allows different handling for different event types
- Makes it easy to extend functionality without modifying core code

### System Integration
- Daemon mode for running as a background service
- Proper signal handling for clean startup/shutdown
- PID file management for service control
- System logging through syslog

### Error Handling and Robustness
- Handles various error conditions gracefully
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Ensures clean resource management

## Value Proposition
In essence, the application transforms the raw filesystem events from inotify into a useful tool that can:
- Monitor specific directories for changes
- Filter those changes based on patterns
- Take customizable actions when changes occur
- Run reliably as a system service
- Log activities appropriately

## Use Cases
This makes the application valuable for scenarios like:
- Triggering build processes when source files change
- Monitoring log directories for new entries
- Watching configuration files for modifications
- Detecting unauthorized file modifications for security purposes
- Automating workflows based on file activity
